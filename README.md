# Snake-Game-Using-PyGame

Snake game is a computer action game, whose goal is to control a snake to move and collect food in a map. In this Snake game, the player uses the WASD keys to move a "snake" around the board. As the snake finds food, it eats the food and thereby grows larger. The game ends when the snake either hits itself or moves into itself. The goal is to make the snake as large as possible before that happens.
